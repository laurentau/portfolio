          Hi, I'm <span className="font-semibold">Lauren Tau</span>, a 22-year-old
          passionate software developer who enjoys building digital experiences
          that are both functional and beautiful. I specialize in crafting
          responsive web interfaces with modern technologies like React and
          Tailwind CSS.  
        </p>

        {/* Paragraph about my hobbies and interests */}
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
          Outside of coding, I love swimming, reading, and singing. Iâ€™m also
          passionate about public speaking and athletics, which keep me active
          and help me develop strong communication and teamwork skills. I
          believe balancing technology with personal interests makes me a more
          creative and well-rounded developer.
